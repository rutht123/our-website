        <h3>Endangered Species Colour Code</h3>
        
        <p>Throughout the website you'll notice that the animal names appear in different colours. This is with the aim of highlighting that our grandchildren might not know the same biodiverse world of the desert that we are lucky to know today. We've decided to use a traffic light system to highlight the species that are at most risk of extinction, with green species being in the least danger to red speces being the most at risk. To find out more about what you can do to save the species in red and yellow visit WWF's website.</p>
